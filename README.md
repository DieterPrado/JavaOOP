### General info
This repository contains files and explanations about Java OOP course. In the Java OOP course I reinforced knowledge about OOP and learned new thigs about OOP but oriented to Java. This course taught more about class methods manipulation. The repository contains files such as Doctor, Patient, Nurse, and User. Inside the model folder are the classes used, being User the super class and Nurse, Patient and Doctor classes that inherit from it. ISchedulable is an interface and AppointmentDoctor and AppointmentNurse implement it. All these files are found separately so that the code is modular, all working through the Main class.
